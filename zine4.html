Text-editing in the terminal <strong>challenges traditional ways to treat text</strong> on a white A4 canvas. The terminal can be used for scraping content from the web as much as automating text layout into patterns. The methodologies presented in this zine, stand as <strong> an introduction to alternative editing techniques.</strong> Because, disclaimer, the very best way to layout text without DTP softwares (adobe, etc) is by using mark-up language such as HTML styled with CSS, programming languages built for web editing. These require a deeper learning of these languages, which can't be achieved from these zines. <br><br>
This zine #4 will bring you to a funny <strong>web-scraping</strong> introduction, followed by two ways of <strong>automating the editing of the text.</strong> At the end, a bonus introduces you to vim a command-line-based text-editor !!! expert level ;)

          <h4>#1 web scraping</h4>
          <p>Web scraping or web harvesting is <strong>the automation of the structured data extraction process from websites.</strong></p>
          <p>An interesting way to get introduce to web scraping, is to use <strong>a Python Library which will extract content from wikipedia pages.</strong> The first step is to install the library.</p>
      </div>
      <div>
                <p>-> to understand better the system of packages in the terminal, you can refer to the zine #3, page 4. </p>
      </div>

          <p class="border">
            ->In 1989, Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist conceived <strong>the World Wide Web.</strong> The static informations were displayed in html, which made it easy for developers to write scripts that could extract data programmatically. But the evolution of the web with dynamic websites challenged the traditional scraping techniques. Expensive dedicated software has been developed, now pushed further for the building of machine-learning training datasets.<br><br>
In its essence web scraping is illegal. But no regulations are binding; results of court cases have proved that web scraping legacy is a case-by-case matter. Web scraping often involves <strong>screen-scraping,</strong> which is <strong>the collection of pre-rendered information from the front end.</strong> This activity won't affect a website's technical angle. Plus, data scraped this way are often unprotected, and anyone can collect them.<br>So for an individual practice, <strong>space still exists for a bit of scrapping. </strong>

      <h4>#2 text-editing</h4>
      <p>Once this text is copied, let's try to edit it in a poster ! For this, open a new terminal window and type :</p>
      <p><strong>1. Install dependancies</strong></p>
      <p class="casca">pip install asciiwriter</p>
      <p class="casca">pip install argparse</p>
      <hr>
      <p><strong>2. Download the script</strong></p>
      <p>- Get on <a href="http://www.becomingnoob.com/">becomingnoob.com</a></p>
      <p>- Open the door, and click on "workshop", download the document called "text_lines.py"</p>
      <p>- Place it in your desktop, then type</p>
      <p class="casca">cd Desktop</p>
      <hr>
      <p><strong>3. Run the command</strong></p>
      <p>- To achieve the following effect, run this command</p>
      <p class="casca">python text_lines.py "Becoming A Noob"</p>
      <p>The result should be displayed in the terminal !</p>
      <hr>
      <p><strong>4. Adapt the variables</strong></p>
      <p>- Download a text editor : Visual Studio Code or Sublime text</p>
      <p>- Open "text_lines.py" in the text editor</p>
      <p>- Play with the width, height and amplitudes of the outcome line 13 and 20 !</p>

      <h4>#3 text-editing</h4>
      <p>Another technic to edit the text extracted previously would be to integrate it as an ascii Image. For this, open a new terminal window and type :</p>
      <p><strong>1. Install dependancies</strong></p>
      <p class="casca">pip install pillow</p>
      <p class="casca">pip install reportlab</p>
      <p class="casca">pip install argparse</p>
      <hr>
      <p><strong>2. Download the script</strong></p>
      <p>- Get on <a href="http://www.becomingnoob.com/">becomingnoob.com</a></p>
      <p>- Open the door, and click on "workshop", download the document called "ascii_art.py"</p>
      <p>- Place it in a new folder in your desktop called "Ascii-test", then type</p>
      <p class="casca"> cd Desktop\Ascii-test</p>
      <p>- Add the image you want to work with in the folder</p>
      <p>- Add a .txt file with the text you want to work with in folder</p>
      <hr>
      <p><strong>3. Run the command</strong></p>
      <p>- To achieve the following effect, run this command</p>
      <p class="casca">python ascii_art.py your-image.jpg your-text.txt output-name.pdf </p>
      <p>The result should be appear in the folder as you named it ! To check it :</p>
      <p class="casca"> start (open on mac) output-name.pdf</p>
      <hr>
      

    </div>
    <div id="chap2">
      <div>
      <p><strong>4. Adapt the variables in the command</strong></p>
      <p>- Play with the width and font size of your output at the end of your command :</p>
      <p class="casca">--width 150 --font_size 5 </p>
      <p>150 as a number of caracters and 5 as the font size in pt</p>
      <hr>
      <p><strong>5. Adapt the variables in a text editor</strong></p>
      <p>- Download a text editor : Visual Studio Code or Sublime text</p>
      <p>- Open "ascii-art.py" in the text editor</p>
      <p>- Play with the brightness on line 23 !</p>

 The symptoms of accelerated crisis are widely recognized. Multiple attempts have been made to explai
 n them. I believe that this crisis is rooted in a major twofold experiment which has failed, and I c
 laim that the resolution of the crisis begins with a recognition of the failure. For a hundred years
 we have tried to make mac ines work for men and to school men for life in their service. Now it tur
 ns out that machines do not “work” and that people cannot be schooled for a life at the service of m
 achines. The hypothesis on which the experiment was built must now be discarded. The hypothesis was 
that machines can replace slaves. Ivan Illich - Tools for Conviviality http://clevercycles.com/tools

          <p>Vim a <strong>highly configurable text editor</strong> built to enable efficient text editing. It is very useful to write and modify codes or texts in every text format possible (.html, .txt, .py, .css, etc). </p>
          <p>Its <strong> text-based interface</strong> refers to the terminal's, and Vim can be opened directly from it as well. It makes it easier to naviguate from one and another. It is based on the same principle : the user can activate a multitude of commands, but they have to be known. They are no buttons for anything, everything happens <strong>from the keyboard.</strong> </p>
        <!--VIM--> 
        <p><strong>Install VIM</strong></p>
        <p>->On windows, vim must be installed and opened as an application. Check the <a href="https://www.vim.org/download.php">Vim website</a> (vim.org/download.php) to follow the instructions.</p>
        <p>-> On mac just run : <strong class="casca">brew install vim</strong></p>
        <hr>
          <h5>in practice</h5>
          <p>Because of the text-based interface, it is very easy to feel lost in vim the first time using it. In fact it requires to already know a few commands to be able to do a simple text-editing. That's why "vimtutor" has been developped. It is openable directly from the terminal typing :<strong class="casca">vimtutor</strong></p>

        <p>A window opens and makes the user going through various exercises to comprehend the essential commands and keyboard actions.</p>
        <p><strong>Modes :</strong> Vim has 3 editing modes. They are accessible via keyboard shortcuts.  
          <ul>
            <li>Command (default) : to write commands <br>
              type <strong class="code">esc</strong></li>

            <li>Visual : to select<br> type <strong class="code">v or V </strong></li>
          </ul></p>
          <hr>
        <p><strong>Naviguation :</strong> To move around, select text, the faster in vim is tu use the keyboard (again) and not the mouse. Quite easy to remember, it has to become a part of the user's muscle memory to be really efficent, doable with some practice.</p>
        <pre> 
        /\         press

        <p><strong>Buffers :</strong> are editing workflows wich enable to open temporary space in the memory to store opened files, open and edit parallel files, check a document, etc. The switch from a buffer to another is quite easy and improve considerably the speed and efficiency of the editor. </p>
        <p>The most usefull one at first can be called by typing <strong class="code">:help</strong>. And a buffer will be opened with an access to Vim help ressources, where you can scroll in all the explanation of possible commands.</p>
