Becoming A Noob is a project that seeks to bring creative people closer to technology. Their day-to-day use, mainly driven by a need to communicate about their work, is monopolised by complex softwares (such as the Adobe suite). There is value in regaining a degree of freedom through simpler, more accessible digital creative tools.
Fuelled by research into the gap between software and hardware, Becoming A Noob offers a collection of web-to-print zines as a methodology for understanding the machine and using the terminal for creative purposes.
This research is accompanied by the creation of a workshop, documented below. A sustainable and conscious use of computers remains an alternative practice and therefore requires a space for the exchange of knowledge between users. The zines are activated and used as a learning medium.
A noob, shortened from “newbie”, is a slang term for an inexperienced player in an online game. Becoming A Noob is a gateway for creative people to technology, to overcome the perception that autonomous digital practices are exclusively reserved to coders and engineers.
